107217,https://www.klook.com/en-AU/activity/107217,['Attraction passes'],"['Solo', 'Couple', 'Group', 'Family']",4.0,Strong fit as a citywide attraction pass; title and images are clear and relevant. Category should be set to 'Attraction passes' (not generic 'Attractions'). Description is informative but contains repeated headings/marketing copy. Location set to Empire State Building is misleading for a digital pass with multiple venuesâ€”update to citywide/no meeting point. Overall suitable for all audiences.,https://platform.openai.com/logs/resp_68d90465dabc8195a142d6997a618503010ff01a0ee59ebe
