Description is informative but contains a key inconsistency: validity is stated as 60 days in multiple places, then 30 days after activation later—this needs correction. Location (Las Vegas) is correct. Overall suitable with minor copy edits and image selection refinement.   \n",
       "1                                                    Strong, clear title and comprehensive description for a multi-day all-inclusive city pass covering 30+ Miami-area attractions. Images are relevant; avoid image #1 due to heavy promotional overlay. Best category is Attractions & Tickets > Attraction passes (current category simply ‘Attractions’ is too broad). Location is set to a specific venue (Bayfront Park amphitheater) though the product is app-based and citywide—adjust to citywide location to prevent confusion. Suitable for all audience types.   \n",

Category should be Attractions & Tickets > Attraction passes. Suitable for all traveler types.   \n",

Imagery is relevant and family-friendly; Image 1 is an ideal hero. Category should be Attractions & Tickets > Zoos & aquariums. Description covers highlights, inclusions, hours and access clearly. Location coordinates align with ICON Park area; minor red flag: address line has a typo ('Orando' instead of 'Orlando'). Overall suitable for LE with small copy edit.   \n",
       "4  Strong, clear offer for an all‑inclusive New York attraction pass with multiple durations. Title is clear (could be refined to 'Go City: New York All‑Inclusive Pass'). Images are relevant; avoid Image 1 due to heavy promotional overlay. Category should be Attractions & Tickets > Attraction passes. Description is informative but has duplicated headings and could be tightened. Location is pinned to the Empire State Building, which is fine as an anchor but the pass is citywide—ensure copy reflects that. Overall suitable for Luxury Escapes’ audience.   \n",
